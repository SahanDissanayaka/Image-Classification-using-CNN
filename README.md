# Image-Classification-using-CNN

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, created as part of **EN3150 Assignment 03** in Pattern Recognition module. The project uses PyTorch to build and train a custom CNN and fine-tunes state-of-the-art pretrained models.

## Features
1. **Custom CNN Implementation**: A simple CNN architecture with convolutional, max-pooling, fully connected layers, and dropout for regularization.
2. **Fine-tuning Pretrained Models**: ResNet18 and AlexNet are fine-tuned to compare performance with the custom CNN.
3. **Loss Visualization**: Training and validation loss curves are plotted for model evaluation.
4. **Experimentation**: The project explores different learning rates and their effects on model performance.
